# Galileus
Galileus is an audio production software that allows users to program sounds and trigger them with a single button press. It simplifies the audio directing process, providing a seamless and efficient way to control and execute various sound elements during productions.

## Key features:
- __Simplified Planning__: An intuitive interface for planning production activities, allowing operators to easily organize technical elements based on the schedule of worship services.
- __Advanced Automation__: Gradual implementation of automation features to perform recurring tasks, allowing operators to focus on more creative aspects of production.
- __Media Management__: Centralized storage of multimedia content (audio, video, presentations) with integrated playback tools for a seamless transition during events.

__It is important to note that the project is currently in the Alpha stage, and the features have not been implemented yet.__
